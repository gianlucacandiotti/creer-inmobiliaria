description: >-
  The fair-sized and versatile floor plan as well as the desired location
  already make this apartment attractive, but the rare perfect sea view makes it
  unique!


  The kitchen display case and headland separate it from the spacious living room. Black levels and stylish white furniture as well as refurbished appliances meet the needs of even the most demanding home chef. The living room basks in daylight by the sea and there is enough space for a group of sofas as well as for a large group of meals. A beautiful atmosphere brings a special atmosphere and leveling.


  The bedrooms have great storage space, plenty of space for a double bed and of course their own sea views. The kitchen has access to the utility room, which also has a second toilet. The entrance hall opens to a neat and spacious bathroom and sauna.


  The glazed balcony faces south and is the perfect place to watch the stunning archipelago landscape as the sun shines through the day.


  The apartment also has a well-functioning cooling device. In the same store, a parking space equipped with an electric car charging system is sold.


  You can get a boat mooring right from the boat dock right in front of the house by joining the Aurinkolahti boat club. The large sandy beach of Aurinkolahti opens next to it. Outdoor terrain next to the Uutelan and Kallahti peninsulas. Vuosaari's excellent golf course is also a short distance away. Excellent public transport links and varied local services nearby.
